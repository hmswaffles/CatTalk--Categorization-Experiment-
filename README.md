Categorization experiment for the Ivry Motor-Cognition Laboratory
================================================================


From stimulus generation to randomization to millisecond data collection, this code contains everything needed to run one bona-fide emperical research project. Specifically, this experiment looks at identifying different modes of human categorization (explicit and implicit) via reaction times to generated stimuli, and can also run verbal interference as part of the task.
